# About me

Hello there!

I'm Filipe Rodrigues <sup class="ipa">([IPA][ipa]: /fi.ˈli.pɘ
rʊ.ˈdri.ɡəʒ/)</sup>. I was born in the very-late-80s in Portugal, where
I still live. I don't take myself very seriously, nor should you!

On the internet, and often <abbr title="Away From Keyboard">AFK</abbr>,
I usually go by "shello"<sup class="ipa">([IPA][ipa]: /ˈʃɛ.lːo/)</sup>,
the handle I've used since the early 2000s.

I spend probably too much of my own time among computers, but I'm also
paid for doing that, working mostly on back-end web development.

On the technology front, the topics I like to explore, and hold *firm*
opinions on (ranging from educated to laughably informed) are UNIX-like
systems, scripting, security, and programming habits.

Beyond computers and technology, my interests span sciences,
electronics, visual arts, puzzles, and nature. Some of them make part of
my pastimes.

I'm a lover of furry friends like ferrets, otters, hedgehogs and
owls&mdash;but I'm not a guardian to any animal.
